Trying to learn and work with Express.js

## Running

```
npm install
export MYAPP_VAR1=value1; export MYAPP_VAR2=value2; npm start
```

Accessing localhost:3000 in a browser will now serve public/index.html, and have a button for loading VAR1 and VAR2 from a JS variable.

## About

Currently includes:

* Demo of serving system environment variables with a given prefix as a JS file that can be loaded into an HTML page as a static resource.
* Introductory examples from Vue.js documentation.

Code adapted from several examples:
